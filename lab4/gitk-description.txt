gitk Description:

The upper-left subwindow provides information regarding past commits. For any
given commit, this window can be used to see the commit message, as well
as the branch that the commit was made to.

The upper-middle subwindow shows the name and email address of the author
of a commit.

The upper-right subwindow gives the date and time of a commit.

The middle portion that separates the top and bottom subwindows gives
the SHA1 ID of a given commit, and displays the current row that is selected.
There are also text fields that can be used to search for commits with
specific properties.

The bottom-left subwindow gives more detailed information about the selected
commit, including the author, committer, parent, child, branches, follows, and
precedes. The lower portion of the window also shows the commit's changes in
diff format.

The bottom-right subwindow lists the files that were changed due to the
selected commit.
