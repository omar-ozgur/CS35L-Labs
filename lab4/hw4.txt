*** Assignment 4 ***

Homework Log:

1)
In order to begin the homework assignment, I logged into a SEASNET server with
the following command:
	ssh ozgur@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu

Next, I navigated to my "Diffutils" directory with the following command:
	cd cs35l/hw4/diffutils

2)
In order to check out version 3.0 of the program to a branch called "quote", I
ran the following command:
	git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3)
In order to apply the patch from file "quote-3.0-patch.txt", I ran the
following command:
	patch -p1 <../quote-3.0-patch.txt

4)
Based on the Emacs documentation, the Emacs command "add-change-log-entry-other
-window" (C-x 4 a) can be used to add a ChangeLog entry for the currently
opened file.

5)
In order to get a list of the modified files, I ran the following command:
	git status

A portion of the output is listed below:
	modified:   src/cmp.c
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/diff3.c
	modified:   src/dir.c
	modified:   src/sdiff.c
	modified:   src/util.c

For each of these files, I ran the following commands in order to create a
ChangeLog entry:
	emacs <file name>
	C-x 4 a
	* Typed message: "Changed grave accents to apostrophes" *
	C-x C-c y

After using the commands listed above to create ChangeLog entries for all
of the modified files, I used "cat ChangeLog" and "cat ChangeLog-2008" in
order to ensure that the formating of the ChangeLog entries was the same.

6)
In order to create a new commit, with the ChangeLog file as the commit message,
I ran the following commands:
	git add .
	git commit -F ChangeLog

7)
In order to generate a new patch in a file called "formatted-patch.txt", I ran
the following command:
	git format-patch -1 --stdout >formatted-patch.txt

8)
For this step of the homework, my partner was Jahan Cherian.
In order to swap patch files with Jahan, I first used the following command to
move my patch file from the linux server to my local desktop:
	cp ozgur@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu:~/cs35l/lab4/formatted-patch.txt \
formatted-patch.txt

After swapping patch files with my partner, I copied Jahan's patch file to the
linux server with the following command:
	scp formatted-patch.txt \
ozgur@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu:~/cs35l/lab4/formatted-patch-partner.txt

In order to test Jahan's patch, I used "cd diffutils" in order to enter the
project directory, and then I ran the following commands:
	git checkout v3.0 -b partner
	git am <../formatted-patch-partner.txt
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make
	make check

9)
To view my partner's ChangeLog file, I ran the following commands:
	make distdir
	cat diffutils-3.0.1-af08/ChangeLog

After inspecting the ChangeLog based on my partner's patch, I found that
everything was applied properly as expected.

In order to test that my patch worked as well, I ran the following commands:
	git add .
	git commit -m "Applied partner's patch"
	git checkout quote
	make distdir
	cat diffutils-3.0.1-c63e/ChangeLog

Based on the ChangeLog output, I found that my patch was applied properly as
well.

10)
In order to prepare to run "gitk" on the GNU Emacs git repository, I logged out
of the linux server, and installed XQuartz on my mac. Then I re-logged into the
linux server with the following command:
	ssh -X ozgur@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu

I then downloaded a copy of the GNU Emacs git repository to my home directory
by running the following command:
	git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git

After the repository was downloaded, I used the command "cd emacs" to enter the
main directory, and used the command "gitk", which opened a window that had
detailed information about the history of the commits for that repository. A
screenshot of the window, as well as a description of the functions of the
subwindows, is provided in the assignment submission.
