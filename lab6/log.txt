*** Assignment 6 ***

Laboratory Log:

For this laboratory assignment, my partner was Jahan Cherian.

In order to begin the lab, I created a bootable USB drive for Ubuntu by
following instructions at the following website:
	http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx

After booting up Ubuntu and opening a terminal window, I ran the following
command in order to see if the openssh client and server programs were
installed:
	dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

Since the openssh-server program was not installed, I ran the following
command to install it:
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server

In order to generate a new public and private key, I ran the following
command:
	ssh-keygen
When prompted for options such as a file location to save the keys, I
pressed "enter" in order to use the default settings. The full output is
shown below:
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa):
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	Enter same passphrase again:
	Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

For the first part of the lab, my terminal was used as a client, and Jahan's
terminal was used as a server.

On Jahan's computer (the server), a user account was created for me by using
the following commands:
	sudo useradd -d /home/omar/ -m omar
	sudo passwd omar
	cd /home/omar
	sudo mkdir .ssh
This caused a username, password, and .ssh directory to be created for me
on the server.

Once my account was created, Jahan ran the following commands in order to
give me full ownership of my account on the server:
	sudo chown -R omar .ssh
	sudo chmod 700 .ssh

In order to find the ip address of the server, Jahan ran the command "ifconfig"
in his terminal. This showed that the inet address was 169.232.123.73.

In order to configure key-based authentication, I ran the following command
to copy my public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys directory on the server:
	ssh-copy-id -i omar@169.232.123.73

Afterwards, I added my private key to ssh-agent by running the following
command:
	ssh-add
This allowed for me to log into the server without always typing my password.

In order to login to the server normally, I ran the following command:
	ssh omar@192.232.123.73

In order to login to the server with X11 session forwarding, I used the -X
option in the following command:
	ssh -X omar@192.232.123.73

After logging in with X11 session forwarding, I was able to run programs such
as firefox and xterm, and have the GUI show on my screen.

Afterwards, I began using my computer as a server, and Jahan became the client.

In order to create a username, password, and .ssh directory for Jahan, I ran
the following commands:
	sudo useradd -d /home/jahan/ -m jahan
	sudo passwd jahan
	cd /home/jahan
	sudo mkdir .ssh

In order to give Jahan ownership permissions on his server folder, I ran the
following commands:
	sudo chown -R jahan .ssh
	sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Next, I ran "ifconfig" to find that my inet ip address was 169.232.123.100.

After Jahan correctly copied his public key to my server, and saved his
private key in ssh-agent, he was able to login to my server with the ssh
-X option, and run programs such as firefox and xterm. The GUI's of these
programs appeared on his computer screen, as expected.
