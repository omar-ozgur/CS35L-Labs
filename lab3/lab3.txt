*** Assignment 3 ***

Laboratory Log:

In order to begin the laboratory assignment, I downloaded the "Coreutils 7.6"
program by running the following command:
  wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
this stored the file "coreutils-7.6.tar.gz" in my home directory.

In order to unzip the file, I ran the following command:
  tar -xvzf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
This extracted the files from the zipped tar file to the directory 
"Coreutils-7.6". In the "tar" command, option "-x" indicates that the contents
should be extracted. Option "-v" indicates that verbose output should be
displayed. Option "-z" indicates the use of gzip to unzip the archive. And
option "-f" indicates allows for the name of the archive to be specified.

In order to begin compiling and installing Coreutils, I created a new directory
by running the following command:
  mkdir ~/coreutils
This created the directory "coreutils" in my home directory.

After creating the "coreutils" directory, I navigated to the "Coreutils-7.6"
directory by using the following command:
  cd ~/Coreutils-7.6

In order to read more about the "coreutils" program, I used the following
commands to read the README and INSTALL files that were provided:
  cat README
  cat INSTALL
In the "INSTALL" file, I found that the "configure" executable could be run
with the "--prefix" option in order to specify the install directory of the
program with an absolute path.

In order to find the absolute path of the "~/coreutils" directory, I used the
following command:
  readlink -f ~/coreutils
This command printed the output "/w/home.07/cs/ugrad/ozgur/coreutils", which is
the absolute path that I was looking for. Therefore, a proper Makefile for the
program was created by running the following command:
  ./configure --prefix=/w/home.07/cs/ugrad/ozgur/coreutils

In order to actually compile the program I ran the following command:
  make

In order to install the program in the "~/coreutils" folder, I ran the
following command:
  make install

In order to reproduce the specified bug with the unmodified version of
coreutils, I navigated to the location of the newly created "ls" executable
with the following command:
  cd ~/coreutils/bin
To reproduce the bug, I first ran the following commands to test the output
of the "ls" executable in the "C" locale:
  export LC_ALL='C'
  ./ls -l
An example of the output that was displayed is shown below:
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 ozgur csugrad 128182 Jan 19 15:41 [
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 ozgur csugrad 119873 Jan 19 15:41 base64
  ...
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 ozgur csugrad  85634 Jan 19 15:41 yes
As can be seen, the date is shown in traditional Unix format.

Next, I ran the following commands to test the outpus of the "ls" executable
in the "en_US.UTF-8" locale:
  export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
  ./ls -l
An example of the output that was displayed is shown below:
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 ozgur csugrad 128182 2016-01-19 15:41 [
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 ozgur csugrad 119873 2016-01-19 15:41 base64
  ...
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 ozgur csugrad  85634 2016-01-19 15:41 yes
As can be seen, the date is shown in the YYYY-MM-DD format, which is not
desireable.

In order to apply the patch, I first navigated to the given webpage that
included PÃ¡draig Brady's patch. I then navigated to the "~/coreutils-7.6"
directory with the following command:
  cd ~/coreutils-7.6
Next, I used the following command to open a new file called "patch.diff"
in the vim text editor:
  vim patch.diff
Next, I copied the patch from the website, and I used the ":set paste" option
in vim to allow for proper pasting from the clipboard. I then typed "a" to
insert text after the cursor's position, and used "Cmd-v" to paste the patch
into the file.

In order to apply the patch from the "patch.diff" file, I opened the manual
page for the "patch" command by using the following command:
  man patch
In the manual page, I found that the option -pnum was used to strip the
specified number of leading slashes from the given file names. By using "-p1",
the correct number of slashes were removed so that the file names in the
diff file corresponded with the file names in my directory.
Based on this information, I used the following command to apply the patch:
  patch -p1 <patch.diff
After running the command, I received the following output, which
indicated that the patch was applied successfully:
  patching file NEWS
  Hunk #1 succeeded at 397 with fuzz 2 (offset 365 lines).
  patching file src/ls.c
  Hunk #1 succeeded at 2013 (offset -1 lines).
  Hunk #2 succeeded at 2028 (offset -1 lines).

In order to compile the program once again, I used the following command:
  make
After running the command, many "make" commands were shown to be executed
in the terminal. The full output is shown below:

The command "make all-recursive" caused make to "enter" each pre-specified
directory in order to check if files needed to be recompiled. The only
folders that contained files that needed to be recompiled were "src" and
"man". Although nothing else needed to be recompiled, it was important to
have make check each folder in order to check that the timestamps of files
were the same as they were previously. By allowing "make" to run recursively
through all of the directories in the project, large projects can be compiled
without manually keeping track of files. This may cause unnecessary checks
to be run, but this saves a lot of time and effort.

After compiling the new version of "ls", I created two files called "new.txt"
and "old.txt" in the home directory by using the following commands:
  touch ~/new.txt
  touch -d "1 year ago" ~/old.txt
The second command uses the -d option in order to artificially make the file
at least 1 year old.

In order to test that the old version of "ls" doesn't work, I navigated to my
home directory with "cd", and then I ran the following commands:
  export LC_ALL='C'
  ./coreutils/bin/ls -l
This gave the following output:
  -rw-r--r--  1 ozgur csugrad        0 Jan 21 14:45 new.txt
  -rw-r--r--  1 ozgur csugrad        0 Jan 21  2015 old.txt
The output was correct in the "C" locale. To test in the en_US.UTF-8 locale, I
used the following commands:
  export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
  ./coreutils/bin/ls -l
This gave the following output:
  -rw-r--r--  1 ozgur csugrad        0 2016-01-21 14:45 new.txt
  -rw-r--r--  1 ozgur csugrad        0 2015-01-21 14:49 old.txt
This shows that the old version of "ls" that was installed still has the bug.

In order to test that the new version works, I first used the following
commands to test "ls" in the "C" locale:
  export LC_ALL='C'
  ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l
This gave the following output for the two files:
  -rw-r--r--  1 ozgur csugrad        0 Jan 21 14:45 new.txt
  -rw-r--r--  1 ozgur csugrad        0 Jan 21  2015 old.txt
This was the correct output, as expected. In order to test that "ls" works in
the en_US.UTF-8 locale, I used the following commands:
  export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
  ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l
This gave the following output:
  -rw-r--r--  1 ozgur csugrad        0 Jan 21 14:45 new.txt
  -rw-r--r--  1 ozgur csugrad        0 Jan 21  2015 old.txt
Again, the output was correct, indicating that the bug was fixed based on the
specified test cases.

Answers to Lab Questions:

1: The line "case_long_iso_time_style:" was removed because it was no longer
required after also removing the line "goto case_long_iso_time_style;". The
 line "goto case_long_iso_time_style;" was the only line that called
"case_long_iso_time_style:". It was not necessary to remove the
line because any time that the case above it was called, the body of the
case would be executed, and the deleted line would have just been ignored.

2: If my company were to switch to this patched version of Coreutils, I would
need to watch out for cases in which this is not compatible with previously
created programs, as well as for cases where users don't understand English or
English-format dates. 
If a previously created program relied on the format of "ls" output in order to
parse data, the new formats for certain locales could alter the results of the
parsing.
Since the altered program causes many locales to use English month names and 
English-format dates, it may be difficult for some users to understand the
output of "ls".
